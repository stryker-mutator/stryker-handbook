# Getting started

Stryker4s is mutation testing framework for Scala. It allows you to test your tests by temporarily inserting bugs.

Currently, the only way to get started with Stryker4s is to use the [command test-runner](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker4s/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#test-runner).
 The `command` test-runner is build tool agnostic and can be used by every build tool that supports Scala. For example, the `sbt test` and `mvn test` both run the specified unit tests in your codebase. This will put you as a user in full control!
